# Tutorial: How to Use META-SiM Projector
This tutorial will guide you through using the META-SiM Projector, a tool that allows you to visualize and analyze single molecule fluorescence microscopy data.

## Introduction
The META-SiM Projector helps you see patterns and trends in your data by projecting single molecule time traces onto a 2D plane or 3D space. This makes it easier to identify these features compared to viewing the raw data.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

* Single molecule fluorescence microscopy data: This data should be in a compatible format, such as .dat or .traces. If you don't have your own data, you can use the demo datasets provided by META-SiM Projector.
* Google Account: You'll need a Google account to run the META-SiM model on your data using Google Colab.
